            About me
        </h3>
        <p class="h6 p1">
            I came from China and was born in Zhejiang Ningbo.
            In 2014, I graduated from undergrad school in Shanghai and came to the US.
            I went to Bentley to get my MSA and graduated in 2016.
            My first job out of school is an auditor in PwC. After three years, I left PwC and joined EY.
            At EY, I'm in Transaction Advisory Services team.
        </p>
        <p class="h6 p1">
            However, after being in Accounting for 4 years, I never found myself satisfied. The WLB isn't good in big 4. And if I go to industry, the career potential isn't good, also the job would be boring. So overall, I realized that what this career gave me does not satisfy my lifestyle need.
            I like skiing, traveling and poker. Click <mark>Hobbies</mark> for more.
            I want to be able to work from anywhere in the world, or at least anywhere from the US.
            I want to have enough time to enjoy my life.
            I also want to have spend more time with my family, friend and my <mark>Furiend</mark>.
        </p>
        <p class="h6 p1">
            After some research, I found software engineer is a job that would satisfy my lifestyle -- and pays well:)
            So here I am, on my new journey to this new <mark>career</mark> that will give me more flexibility and more potential.
